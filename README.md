# OOAD-Project-2
This repository contains the code for Project 2 Problem 1 (a: implement Zookeeper with language of our choice, b: implement Zookeeper with the strategy pattern, c: implement Zookeeper with the observer pattern).  All parts of problem 1 were written in Python 3.7.4.  This repository also contains the PlantUML code and UML images generated for problem 2 (class diagrams for our strategy and observer programs), problem 3 (sequence diagrams for our strategy and observer programs), problem 4 (activity diagrams for our strategy and observer programs), and problem 5 (use case diagrams for our programs with and without observer).  Note that PlantUML doesn't use symbols like +, #, - to indicate access levels.  Instead, green circles indicate public, yellow diamonds indicate protected, red squares indicate private, and italicization indicates that a member is virtual.

### Note:
Random behaviour is implemented in Cat's makeNoise method. When makeNoise is called, one of the five methods of Cat is called randomly.
